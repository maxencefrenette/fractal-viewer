# Fractal Viewer

A simple fractal viewer I made as a weekend project. Displays the manldelbrot
set using WebGL. Based on
[this tutorial](https://gpfault.net/posts/mandelbrot-webgl.txt.html).

## Features

- GPU-accelerated rendering using WebGL
- Panning and zooming with a mouse or a touchscreen
- Support for high-DPI screens

## Limitations

- Zooming doesn't perfectly follow the fingers on touchscreens
- The float precision is quickly reached when zooming
